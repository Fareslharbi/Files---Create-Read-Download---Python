# Files - Create, Read, Download - Python

This project provides a set of Python scripts for creating, reading, and downloading files. It includes the following scripts:

- `download_from_url.py`: Downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to a specified directory.
- `download_util.py`: Contains utility functions for downloading files.
- `file_manager.py`: Provides functions for managing files, such as creating new files and reading file contents.
- `store_files.py`: Stores files in a specified directory.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the desired script using the following command:

   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```

   Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to execute (e.g., `download_from_url.py`).

4. Follow the instructions provided by the script to create, read, or download files as needed.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `download_from_url.py`

This script allows you to download a file from a given URL and save it to a specified directory. It uses the `requests` library to make the HTTP request and `shutil` to save the file.

To use the script, provide the URL of the file to download and the directory where you want to save it. If no filename is specified, the script will use the basename of the URL as the filename.

Example usage:

```python
python download_from_url.py --url https://example.com/file.txt --directory /path/to/save/in/
```

### 2. `download_util.py`

This script contains utility functions for downloading files. It includes the `download_file()` function, which accepts a URL, directory, and optional filename. The function downloads the file from the URL and saves it to the specified directory.

To use the `download_file()` function in your own scripts, import it and call it with the appropriate parameters.

Example usage:

```python
from download_util import download_file

url = "https://example.com/file.txt"
directory = "/path/to/save/in/"
filename = "my_file.txt"

downloaded_file_path = download_file(url, directory, filename)
print(f"File downloaded and saved to: {downloaded_file_path}")
```

### 3. `file_manager.py`

This script provides functions for managing files. It includes functions for creating new files and reading file contents.

To use the functions in your own scripts, import `file_manager` and call the desired functions.

Example usage:

```python
from file_manager import create_file, read_file

filename = "my_file.txt"
content = "Hello, world!"

# Create a new file
create_file(filename)

# Write content to the file
with open(filename, "w") as file:
    file.write(content)

# Read the contents of the file
file_contents = read_file(filename)
print(file_contents)
```

### 4. `store_files.py`

This script provides a simple way to store files in a specified directory. It prompts the user to enter the filename and content of the file to be stored. The file is then created in the specified directory with the given content.

To use the script, run it using the `python store_files.py` command and follow the prompts.
